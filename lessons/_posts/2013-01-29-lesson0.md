# Lesson 00 - Introduction to Visual Studio and C\#

## Visual Studio IDE

We will be using Microsoft's Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for all of our
C# coding. There's a lot of cool features that will making writing programs easier and less error-prone.

Visual Studio Express is freely available; additionally, if you have access to Microsoft Dreamspark
(through affiliation with the University for example), you can download the full version of Visual
Studio for free, which comes with additional features and such. However, Express will suit our needs
for now. 

*Important:* Make sure you register your copy of Visual Studio Express so it doesn't expire!

### Projects

All the programs we create will be in the form of Visual Studio Projects.

1. WPF Applications are Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications that run in a window. 
2. Console applications run in the DOS-style command line.

We will learn to produce both kind of applications listed above. Additionally, we will learn about
.NET websites at a later date.

## Introduction to C\#

C# is a relatively young programming language, similar to C++ and Java but designed to overcome
perceived flaws of those languages. It is is object-oriented from the ground up (we will learn what 
this means later) and this has some obvious implications that we'll talk about right away. 

*Note:* The following really only applies to console applications, which will be our main focus at 
the start. WPF applications have their own quirks we'll deal with later.

### Program Class

Everything line of code you write in C# is part of a 'class'. A class is basically a template for a
type of object (which may or may not correspond to a real-life, physical object). Additionally, every
application needs a 'main' class. By default, Visual Studio creates a Program.cs file as you primary
source file and creates a class named 'Program' to act as your main class. Note that class names
must match file names.

### Main() Method

Much like C++ or Java, every application needs to have a Main() method, which is run whenever the
application is called. You will usually write the primary code you want your program to execute 
within the Main() function. 

### Namespaces

C# uses what are called _Namespaces_ to distinguish between methods and attributes that may be 
similarly named. You declare a namespace simply with the statement `namespace <name of Namespace>` 
and everything between an opening and closing brace is defined within that namespace. By default, 
Visual Studio creates a namespace for everything in your Program Class that is named after your 
application. 

The way namespaces are used is simple. Every method or attribute has what is called a _fully-qualified
name_ which is basically the 'full address' of that method or attribute. For example, if you were to 
define a method called `myMethod()` in the namespace `Alfredo`, then its fully qualified name would 
be `Alfredo.myMethod()`. 

The reason we use namespaces is because someone else might also write a method called `myMethod()` 
and if you wanted to use it in your own application, how do you tell the compiler to distinguish 
between your `myMethod()` and the other `myMethod()`? The answer is namespaces. Because these 
methods are defined in different namespaces (C# requires you to define everything inside _some_ 
namespace) you can use the fully-qualified names to distinguish between `Alfedo.myMethod()` and 
`Bob.myMethod()`. 

However, let's say you're going to use my version of `myMethod()` a lot in your application. It would 
get tiring to always have to write `Alfredo.myMethod()`. C# allows you to declare that you are 'using'
a namespace in your source file and can therefore refer to a method or attribute by its shortened 
name. For example, if you prefaced your code with the statement `using Alfredo`, you could then call 
`myMethod()` without having to use the fully qualified name.

## Data Types

Most of us implicitly understand the idea of data types. We know that 'banana' and 7 are different 
kinds of things and that the statement `banana + 7` makes no sense. Similarly, when you program, progam 
languages distinguish between data types. Some languages are called _Strongly Typed_ languages and 
this means that they require you to explicitly declare the types of variables upon creation. In 
contrast, _Weakly Typed_ languages implicitly assign data types to variables based on the kind of 
data you put in them. C# is a strongly typed language, and so we will be explicitly declare all of 
of our data types.

### Declaring a Variable

It's very simply to declare a variable. You do so with a single statement:

    <data type> <variable name>;

1. _Data Type:_ We will cover below some of the primitive data types in C#. Additionally, a data type 
could be a class, which we will cover in more detail later when we talk about Object-Oriented 
Programming.
                
2. _Variable Name:_ For our purposes, a valid variable name begins with a lower-case letter, contains 
only letters or numbers and is written in camelCase. In camelCase, separate words in a variable name 
are denoted by capitalizing the first letter of each word in the name. For example: `helloWorld`.
