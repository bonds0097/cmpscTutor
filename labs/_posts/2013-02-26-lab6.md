# Lab 06 - Calculating an Average

## Assignment

Write a program that prompts the user to input 6 homework grades and then output the average 
homework grade.

- Store the six grades as an array.
- Write a method the calculates the average of the elements in an array (of any size) and returns it 
as a double.
- Assume the user always inputs a valid integer.

### Bonus

If there is time, also write a method that calculates the standard deviation of the grades (learn 
about standard deviation [here][1]) and displays it.
