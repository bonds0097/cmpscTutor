# Lab 01 - Hurricane Categories

## Background

Hurricane Categories are determined using something called the _Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale_ that 
is based off current wind speeds per the table below:

 Wind Speed      | Category 
----------------:|:--------:
 > 156 MPH       | 5        
 130 - 156 MPH   | 4         
 111 - 129 MPH   | 3        
 96 - 110  MPH   | 2        
 74 - 95 MPH     | 1        

More information at [Wikipedia][1].

## Assignment

Your assignment is to write a program that requests the user's current wind speed and reports back 
what category hurricane they are currently in (I don't know why people are running programs like this 
in the middle of a hurricane, but suspend your disbelief for the purpose of this exercise).

Here is a sample output:

    > Please enter your current wind speed: 112
    > You are in a Category 3 Hurricane.
    
Note that you should also tell the user if they're not in a hurricane at all:

    > Please enter your current wind speed: 12
    > You are not in a hurricane.
