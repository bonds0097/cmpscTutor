# Homework 00 - Quadratic Equation Calculator

## Background

The Quadratic Equation is: `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`

The formula to solve any equation of that form is: `(-b +- Sqrt(b^2 - (4 * a * c))) / (2 * a)`

### Discriminant

The Discriminant D of a quadratic equation is `b^2 - (4 * a * c)`

The value D decides how many and what kinds of solutions the equation has.

- When D > 0, it has two real solutions.
- When D = 0, it has only one real solution.
- When D < 0, it has two imaginary solutions.

## Assignment

Your assignment is simple: given a user's input for a, b and c. Output the real solutions of the 
quadratic equations (roots). Here is a sample output:

    >Please enter the following values.
    > a: 1
    > b: 4
    > c: 3
    >
    > Your discriminant is 4 and you have two real solutions.
    > The two solutions are -3 and -1.
    
### Some Considerations

1. Your program must accept all real numbers (including decimal values and negative numbers).
2. Depending on the value of your [dicriminant][1], you may have either two real solutions, one real 
solution or no real solutions (only imaginary solutions). You only have to input the real solutions, 
but you have to be able tell the user how many solutions there are (2, 1, or 0).
