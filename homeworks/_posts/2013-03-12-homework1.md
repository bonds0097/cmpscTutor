# Homework 01 - Loop Practice

## Background

Iteration loops are one of the most important concepts in programming as they allow you to perform 
repetitive tasks quickly and efficiently. However, before you can write a loop, you have to figure 
out what it is you're iterating on. The following exercises will give you some practice in doing 
this. Feel free to message me on Skype or e-mail if you have trouble with any of these.

## Assignment

Below are 5 different summations. Your job is take the user's input (an integer) and calculate the 
summations using a `for` loop where _n_ is the user's input. Additionally, I have given you the 
formula for each summation so you can compare your loop output to the formula output (they should 
be equal).

### Summation 1 - Sum of Integers from 1 to n

The summation is the sum of numbers from 1 to n. For example, if n = 6, then the summation is:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.

The formula for this summation is `(n * (n + 1))/ 2`.

### Summation 2 - Sum of Squares from 1 to n^2

The summation is the sum of squares from 1 to n^2. For example, if n = 6, then the summation is:

1 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 = 91.

The formula for this summation is `(n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) / 6`.

### Summation 3 - Sum of Cubes from 1 to n^3

The summation is the sum of cubes from 1 to n^3. For example, if n = 4, then the summation is:

1 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100.

The formula for this summation is `(n^2 * (n + 1)^2) / 4`.

### Summation 4

I can't really explain this one with words: 

![Summation 4][1]

If n = 4, then the summation is:

(1/1 - 1/2) + (1/2 - 1/3) + (1/3 - 1/4) + (1/4 - 1/5) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

### Summation 5 - Sum of Odd Numbers

This is the sum of odd numbers from 1 to 2n + 1, so if n = 4, the summation is the sum of odd 
numbers from 1 to 9:

1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25.

The formula for this summation is (n + 1)^2.

##Good luck!
